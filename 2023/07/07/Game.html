		<H1> Making a game</H1>

<p>Date: 07 Jul 2023</p>

<p>So I finally found a programming project that I’m motivated to taking on.</p>

<p>Going to attempt to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram">nonogram</a> type game,
as it should be simple enough and covers quite a bit.</p>

<p>The current plan is to sketch it out in Python, possibly use pygame to draw the interface.
Originally I wanted to go for a plain console game, but the game needs squares, not rectangles
as all fonts are. Tkinter is also a option. Once everything is working to my satisfaction I will
attempt to port it to Rust.</p>

<p>Current plan is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Images stored in a SQLite3 database as plain string, along with some other details.</li>
  <li>Planned support for colors.</li>
  <li>Planned support for any game size (X/Y).</li>
  <li>GUI drawn by pygame</li>
</ul>

<p>I have the extremely rough details worked out, but there is still a whole lot left to figure out.
The images are currently stored as a single string, have still to work out how to format it properly. 
The gameboard size is determined by calculating the square root of the string length, since the board has to be square. 
Color is still being worked out, still have to decide how <em>many</em> colors to support as this determins how the gameboard size is calculated.</p>

<p>It’s not just the game itself that has to be coded. I also need a way to create images with some ease.
Curently two images made, both by hand. Pitty I’m no artist, but how many details can one get into a 5x5, 10x10 or 20x20 image.</p>
